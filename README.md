### About
A simple Ruby / Sinatra app using the [Lithium API](https://lithosphere.lithium.com/t5/rest-api/bd-p/developers-rest-api?leaf-id=Message.kudos.givers#Message.kudos.givers)* to grab lists of users who have given kudos to ideas on the [giffgaff Community](http://community.giffgaff.com/t5/Submit-Great-giffgaff-Ideas/).

Based on an idea from "wonderwoman" hazel

### Installation
To run it locally, simply use rackup.

### Usage
Add the idea number after the url i.e. ``http://<yourdomain.com>/idea/<idea number>`` - a form or something nicer will come later, this is barebones for now.

### To do
download results as CSV, branding, form for submitting numbers, search for ideas, link to user profiles, ranking of ideas by kudos, wow this could get all kinds of complicated...

### License
